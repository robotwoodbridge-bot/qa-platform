Suite Setup      Initialize Contract Suite
Suite Teardown   Delete Ecom Session

*** Variables ***
# Credentials stored in config/settings.yaml; hardcoded here only for the API contract suite
# because this API is a public practice site with shared test credentials.
${LOGIN_EMAIL}       rbridge@gmail.com
${LOGIN_PASSWORD}    Rb123456
# PRODUCT_ID is resolved at suite setup — the practice site resets its catalog,
# so hardcoded product IDs go stale and the API returns 400 "Wrong Product ID".
