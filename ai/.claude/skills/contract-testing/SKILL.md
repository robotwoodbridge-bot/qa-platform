description: Design and triage API contract tests for this lab — schema validation, consumer-driven contracts, and version/breaking-change checks against the REST/GraphQL endpoints. Use when the user asks about contract testing, schema drift, provider/consumer compatibility, or the api-contract CI pipeline.

# Contract Testing Skill

Purpose:
Ensure provider and consumer API contracts stay compatible across versions for
the services exercised by this lab's contract pipeline.
OpenAPI specifications and consumer expectations are the source of truth for the contract tests.

Inputs:

- API endpoints (REST / GraphQL) under test
- Published schemas / OpenAPI specs
- ci/azure-contract-pipeline.yml and .github/workflows/api-contract.yml

Review Areas:

1. Schema validation (request + response)
2. Consumer-driven contracts (expectations per consumer)
3. Backward / forward compatibility
4. Required vs optional fields, additive vs breaking changes
5. Status codes, headers, error envelopes
6. Versioning strategy

Output Format (per finding):

Contract Risk:
Affected Consumer(s):
Compatibility Impact: (additive / breaking)
Evidence:
Recommendation:

Quality Gates:

- No breaking contract changes without a version bump
- Every consumer expectation has a verifying test
- Schema validated on both request and response
